## 1d. About This Dataset

The data has split into two groups:

- training set (train.csv)
- test set (test.csv)

***The training set includes our target variable(dependent variable), passenger survival status***(also known as the ground truth from the Titanic tragedy) along with other independent features like gender, class, fare, and Pclass. 

The test set should be used to see how well our model performs on unseen data. When we say unseen data, we mean that the algorithm or machine learning models have no relation to the test data. We do not want to use any part of the test data in any way to modify our algorithms; Which are the reasons why we clean our test data and train data separately. ***The test set does not provide passengers survival status***. We are going to use our model to predict passenger survival status.

Now let's go through the features and describe a little. There is a couple of different type of variables, They are...

***
**Categorical:**
- **Nominal**(variables that have two or more categories, but which do not have an intrinsic order.)
   > - **Cabin**
   > - **Embarked**(Port of Embarkation)
            C(Cherbourg)
            Q(Queenstown) 
            S(Southampton)
        
- **Dichotomous**(Nominal variable with only two categories)
   > - **Sex**
            Female
            Male
- **Ordinal**(variables that have two or more categories just like nominal variables. Only the categories can also be ordered or ranked.)
   > - **Pclass** (A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)) 
            1(Upper)
            2(Middle) 
            3(Lower)
***
**Numeric:**
- **Discrete**
  >  - **Passenger ID**(Unique identifing # for each passenger)
  >  - **SibSp**
  >  - **Parch**
  >  - **Survived** (Our outcome or dependent variable)
            0
            1
            
        
- **Continous**
>  - **Age**
>  - **Fare**
***
**Text Variable**
> - **Ticket** (Ticket number for passenger.)
> - **Name**(  Name of the passenger.)
